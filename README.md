The tree works by putting new nodes either on the right or left of the root ( if there isnt a root make it the root ), so if it is bigger make the node connect on the right if it is smaller on the left.

Bonus 1 : Use stack for array's that have repeating numbers.
Bonus 2 : Use a self Balancing tree .
